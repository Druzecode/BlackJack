**Blackjack**

This project started as a C project for a second-term, freshman C programming course in... well, a long time ago.  At some point, the original code was directly ported to C# to make it easier to run.

Recently, the game was ported to Python in an effort to run it on a TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator.  Most of the original structure has remained the same with added tests, support for different display sizes, and some optimizations.
